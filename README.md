# count-anomalies
Anomaly detection using Bayesian hierarchical models - simulation study.

[View report](https://jmeydam.github.io/count-anomalies/simulation_study.html)

This study provided the foundation for a 
[prototype](https://jmeydam.github.io/countcheck/) (R package).

The distributions and parameters in the simulation study were chosen
so that the generated data is comparable to certain data of interest.
The prototype is meant to be used for roughly the same kind of data.
